SIMToolbox: a MATLAB toolbox for structured illumination 
fluorescence microscopy

SIMToolbox is an open-source, modular set of functions for MATLAB equipped with a user friendly graphical interface 
and designed for processing data acquired by structured illumination microscopy. 


SIMToolbox, example data, and the online documentation are freely accessible at https://simtoolbox.github.io/

SIMToolbox - MATLAB PACKAGE
----------------------

This folder contains MATLAB codes for the SIMToolbox. This comprehensive set of MATLAB functions is also equipped with a user friendly interface. 
Open the file "SIMToolbox.m" in MATLAB and run it. It will launch the SIMToolbox GUI and automatically add all the necessary functions into your 
MATLAB path. If you do not have MATLAB, you can use the standalone application instead. You may download it on our website: 
https://simtoolbox.github.io/

Compatibility notes

The functions were mainly developed with 64bit MATLAB versions 2012b, 2014a, 2015a in Windows 7. The MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox is required. 
SIMToolbox also requires the MATLAB YAML package by Kota Yamaguchi [9] to convert MATLAB objects to/from YAML format. 
Note that this package is installed automatically when using the GUI.
